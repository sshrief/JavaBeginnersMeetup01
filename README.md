Requirements for the parking ticket machine:

As a car owner I want to pay for my parking lot.
In order to pay, I enter my licence plate number (6 characters).
I can increase or decrease the paid amount with a sum of 10 cents or 1 euro, when I do so, the end time on the screen will be adjusted.
When the end time is as I want it to be, I can click a button "Done"; when I do so, my licenceplate number, the current date and time and the end date and time will appear on the screen. After a few seconds, the screen goes back to the start screen.

As a civil servant I want to be able to get a list containing the licence plate numbers of parked cars with end date and time, and a warning when the end time has passed.
I want to be able to enter a licence plate number to check the end time of a specific car.
I want to be able to adjust the parking fee.
